# Credit Card Default Prediction

This project applies data science and machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer will default on their credit card payment next month. The dataset is sourced from a real-world credit dataset and includes demographic, billing, and payment information.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Feature selection using correlation and RFE
- Handling imbalanced data with undersampling
- Model training using Random Forest with custom thresholds
- Performance evaluation using precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix
- Feature importance ranking and retraining with top features

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Imbalanced-learn
- Jupyter/Colab (originally written in notebook format)

## Results Summary
- Accuracy: 0.7983
- Precision: 0.5543
- Recall: 0.4006
- F1 Score: 0.8108

## Future Improvements
- **Recall Boosting:** Improve the model’s ability to identify more true defaulters, possibly by:
  - Tuning the classification threshold using ROC/PR curves
  - Using recall-oriented scoring during model training
- **Oversampling (SMOTE):** Implement synthetic minority oversampling instead of undersampling to retain all majority-class samples while addressing imbalance.
- **Model Comparison:** Test additional models like XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and SVMs to balance precision-recall tradeoffs.
- **Cross-Validation:** Incorporate stratified k-fold cross-validation for more stable metric reporting.
- **Feature Engineering:** Derive behavioral features from bill/payment history, such as trends or ratios, to capture latent patterns.
- **Explainability:** Apply SHAP or LIME to make predictions interpretable and actionable for stakeholders.
- **Deployment Potential:** Wrap the model into a Streamlit or Flask web app for real-time risk scoring.
